# Contributing To A Rearc AWS Data Exchange Product

ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³ First of all, **THANK YOU** for being interested in contributing to one of our projects ðŸŽ‰ðŸ¥³

From the start of our AWS Data Exchange (ADX) initiative we knew we wanted to have an open dialogue with our subscribers. While we try our best to optimize the packaging of our ADX products to be as accommodating as possible, we appreciate there may be use-cases we have overlooked. By contributing to this project, you have an opportunity to improve the usability of the data included with this product not only for yourself, but for anyone who subscribes to this product through ADX. If your contribution is applicable to more than one of our ADX listings, we will gladly improve those products as well!

You can learn about Rearcâ€™s data services by visiting [https://www.rearc.io/data]( https://www.rearc.io/data).

Below is a set of guidelines for contributing to any of the ADX product repositories available on the [Rearc Data GitHub account](https://github.com/rearc-data). 

## I Have A Question And/Or Issue To Report. What Is The Best Way To Contact Rearc?
If you have an issue to report specific to the source code in this repository you can [open a GitHub issue](https://github.com/rearc-data/publish-a-data-product-on-aws-data-exchange/issues). Before opening an issue please review the existing suggestions to see if your idea is already there. If already present, please comment on the existing issue instead of making a new one.

If you have a general inquiry about Rearc's data services you can send an email to data@rearc.io. We would love to hear any suggestion, question or request you may have. 

## What Should I Know Before I Get Started?

#### What Is AWS Data Exchange?
> [AWS Data Exchange](https://aws.amazon.com/data-exchange/) is a data marketplace that makes it easy for AWS customers to securely find, subscribe to, and use third-party data in the cloud.

#### Who Is Rearc?
> [Rearc](https://www.rearc.io) is a data provider and one of the launch partners for AWS Data Exchange. Products published by Rearc on ADX can be found [here](https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/search/results?page=1&filters=VendorId&VendorId=a8a86da2-b2d1-4fae-992d-03494e90590b&searchTerms=rearc&category=d5a43d97-558f-4be7-8543-cce265fe6d9d). On ADX we provide a pipeline to automate the (1) sourcing of data, (2) transform data to make it useful for consumers, (3) create a dataset for public consumption on ADX, (4) enact automatic revisions of the dataset and, (5) finally publish the data product.

#### What Are Rearc's Objectives For ADX?
We at Rearc are working tirelessly to lend greater accessibility to interesting and/or important datasets across various disciplines and sources. We realize the direct integration of the ADX, along with other AWS services, facilitates a convenient manner for our subscribers to consume data. For data providers we can supply an automation pipeline, leveraging the AWS platform, to ensure the ubiquity of your data for your consumers.

#### What is Rearc's Philosophy Towards Dataset Formats?
We try as much as possible to preserve of integrity of data we provide through ADX, and most of the time this means delivering datasets exactly as they were presented from their source. Sometimes we make minor alterations to datasets to provide wider usability for ADX subscribers (e.g. adjusting CSV files for SQL column naming conventions). For situations where we are unable to maintain the original data file format (often due to a request from the data consumer or a discrepancy in a data source's delivery pipeline), we try to limit the extent of needed transformations as much as possible.

#### What Tools Are You Using To Allow The Data Harvesting And Automation Of Your ADX Products?
- On our local devices we have chosen to use a combination of [Python](https://www.python.org), [Pip](https://pypi.org/project/pip/), [JQ](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), [AWS CLI V2](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) and other related developer tools for deployment. The specific tools utilized varies on a project-by-project basis. The Python portions of our source code could be adapted into another language with a supported AWS Lambda runtime.
- Most of our ADX projects limit the usage of packages to [The Python Standard Library](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/index.html). By default, Python provides a robust set of tools to access and manipulate popular data file formats, and we exploit these features to their fullest capacity. Frequent packages we used when interacting with datasets include [os](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/os.html), [urllib](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/urllib.html), [json](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/json.html) and [csv](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/csv.html). We also utilize [Boto3](https://boto3.amazonaws.com/v1/documentation/api/latest/index.html), AWS's ASK for Python, which is automatically bundled into AWS Lambda's Python runtimes.
- We are creating various AWS resources throughout the process of deploying and maintaining our ADX projects, including [Data Exchange](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/data-exchange/), [S3](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/s3/), [Lambda](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/) and [EventBridge](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/eventbridge/). The creation of most of the needed resources is streamlined by the [CloudFormation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/) template included with our ADX projects.

#### Directory Layout:
While the exact directory layout for one of our ADX projects can vary on a project-by-project basis, a typical presentation of our projects is as follows:
```
.
â”œâ”€â”€ pre-processing                  # Data provider side source code files and automation code
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pre-processing-code         # Source code
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ lambda_function.py      # Code to interact with ADX for creating a dataset and revision
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ source_data.py          # Code to acquire dataset and perform necessary data transformation
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ pre-processing-cfn.yaml     # CloudFormation template to setup data provider automation
â”œâ”€â”€ dataset-description.md          # Dataset description that goes on the ADX listing
â”œâ”€â”€ product-description.md          # Product description that goes on the ADX listing
â”œâ”€â”€ init.sh                         # Initialization script to kick-off the automation
â”œâ”€â”€ README.md

```
